In order to complete this assignment I followed the lessons that were given as well as the tutorials videos. In my opinion, I had a hard time figuring out how I would get the ellipses to interact. But once I figured that out, everything seem to fall in right into place. This assignment seems a lot easier then last weeks. As far as you can see I have a different size of bubbles as well as different colors cooperating once they meet. Working with these objects and how they interact, I thoroughly enjoyed. I didnâ€™t run into many issues but the tutorial helped guide me through these problems. I didn't get a chance to help the other student because to be honest I didn't have the answers to their problems
