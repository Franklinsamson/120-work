Final Project

For my final project I had a hard time trying to code a astroid simulation game so I scratched that and end up creating my version of pong. I couldn't figure out how to put a backgroud image or audio. I also wanted to add a game over symbol if you missed the ellipse but couldn't incoperate that either. So what we got is what we have.
