#### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

For HW2 I learned how to construct an md file as wel as txt file. I then choose to use Atom for my text editor and the github desktop app because it was suggested by the professor. Last but not least I watched and read all the course material.



#### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

Syncing with github, creating a repository, saving my work, downloaded applications, and creating files were just some of steps I took to complete this assignment.


#### Did you have any problems or issues?How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I didn't have to many problems or issues. I was just having a terrible time following directions. I thought watching the hour long video setup was the first thing to do. That didnt go as planned and was just very confusing to me. But once i started from working with git tab. Everything was clear as day.


#### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

Not at the moment but I'm sure once we get more futher into the semester I will many questions to ask.


#### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

I've done a little bit of coding in the past and this class is already much different from the one I took a couple semesters ago. I seem a bit helpless because it's slowly coming back to me. Getting familarized with coding once again and to be honest it is quite refreshing while trying to Refresh my memory in the process.
