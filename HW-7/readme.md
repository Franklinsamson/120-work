# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

This explains where the ellipse moves throughout the canvas the coding originally draws the parameters and sets up the variables. To command the parameters of the ball the fist section of coding determines the variables. In order to set up the background and canvas the second line of coding does just that. The course of the balls' path is through the height and width command which the draw functions shares the code throughout of Boolean commands. the third line of coding functions describes the use of the varibles and the fill to create an ellispe. last but not least is the mouse pressed command where when the mouse is pressed the scale of the ellipse alters and supposeably begins to move much faster.


## How did you alter the sketch?
The way I altered this assignment I changed the ball width, the ball.x , the ball.y, the ball.delta_y, and the ball.scale_x. I also changed the width of the canvas size. The fill on the ellipse I added a random function and also tried messing around with the text, textSize, and textFont.
