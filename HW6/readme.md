To be honest I really struggled on this assignment. Not sure if I even did it right but this is what I came up with. In order to complete I read thorugh the basic goals and lesson. This asignment I learned how to be more familiar with variables, work with simple math, used the random function and learned how to also map. I didn't run into many problems. With a little research and going on the p5 website my problems were resolved.
