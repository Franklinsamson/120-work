HW-5

So for this week I learned how to do animation, incoprate simple math and worked with variables. I created shapes along with an abstract image that changes over time. to be honest I struggled with this assignment but, all in all I have fun while doing it. I need to spend more time watching tuturial videos because I know these assignments are just going to get hardest as we go further into the semester.
