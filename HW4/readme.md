HW4

For this assignment I tried to make a potrait of myself but had a hard time doing so. How I completed this assignment is pretty straight forward. I took alot of the funtions professor provide in the video tutorial and tweeked it the best I could and this what I came with. I didn't having many issues besides trying to rotate the right arm so it would replicate the left arm. Besides that I didn't run into anything major while follow each step. I didn't end up helping any classmate due to the fact that I did't know any answers to the questions they were asking.
