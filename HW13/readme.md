Plan

For my final project I want to try and create an astriod shooting video game. The concept is going to be difficult for me but I think I could pull it off. A spaceship that you could move all around the canvas while shooting or avoding the astriods. Hopefully I can include some time of music to make this more playable. If you collide with the astriods then its game over. I going to try to incoperate a scores table as well but. If I can't so be it. It will be just be a shooting simlator video game then.
