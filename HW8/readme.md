HW8

I thought this assignment was fairly easier. Didn't run into many problems like I have been having on the earlier assignments. There is still much room for improvement but with this loop I figured out how not to rewrite every line of code. The only problem I ran into was with my rectagle functions. as  you can see I created a diagonal arrow from an ellipse and rectangle. I wanted to havwe the rectangle rotate as you move the mouse but couldn't incorperate that in this assingment. I think I'm getting the hang of the loops just from reading and watching the tuturial videos.
